# React Word Analytics

## What is this project about?

This project is a basic React project (originally web dev suite) which counts characters/words in a user-inputted string for formats like Twitter/Facebook/etc. When there are too many characters (i.e. above 280 for Twitter) the CSS styling changes the corresponding number to red. It's a very simple web app made to help me learn the React basics.

## What did I learn?

A lot of the basics of front-end without React became so much easier thanks to React. Lots of the logic was translatable, but building this helped me get to that level. It's a simple project nonetheless.
